My new favorite music for hardcore focusing sessions is the intense minimalism of Nisennenmondai.  This trio from Japan churns out epic 15 minute meditations at the boundary of post-rock and dub techno.  They’ve been at it for almost twenty years, and with each subsequent release remove more variability from their sound.

I wasn’t sure which track of theirs to recommend as most of Nisennenmondai’s songs just blend together into a wash of alien sounds and pounding kick drum.  Their new record #N/A is particularly incredible, but I’m linking to a track off their last record which I’m fond of.  Zone out to it.
