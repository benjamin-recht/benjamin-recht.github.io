David Bazan of Pedro the Lion fame just released a fantastic new record *Blanco*, and “Both Hands” is the leadoff track.

I haven’t followed Bazan’s work since Pedro the Lion, but in the interim he’s shifted away from emo indie rock to washed out synth pop.  There is a heavy low-pass filter over all of the instrumentation, and this makes for an appropriate pairing with Bazan’s disaffected baritone.

>I'm probably over it.

I know how you feel, David.

For those of you without Spotify, you can check out Track 2, *Oblivion* on Bazan’s Soundcloud:

This song is also very high quality.
