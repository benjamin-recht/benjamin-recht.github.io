This week’s song is by David Bazan of Pedro the Lion fame.  He just released a great new record *Blanco*, and “Both Hands” is the leadoff track.

I haven’t followed Bazan’s work since Pedro the Lion, but in the interim he’s shifted away from emo indie rock to washed out synth pop.  There is a low-pass filter over everything, and this makes for an appropriate pairing with Bazan’s disaffected baritone.  “Both Hands” is a perfect soundtrack for a gloomy morning on the west coast in June.  And yes, I realize that it’s May, but we're having some unseasonably cold weather this week.

I know how you feel, David.

For those of you without Spotify, you can check out Track 2, *Oblivion* on Bazan’s Soundcloud:



This song is also very high quality.
