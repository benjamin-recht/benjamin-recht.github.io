Happy USA day everyone.  Rather than having one song to rock out to, I compiled a fun playlist of happy jams for accompanying barbecue and shitty lagers.  

It's odd how celebration of independence from colonial rule is celebrate by binge eating and trying to blow off extremities.  It's also is how it inspires all of these sad songs about death, betrayal, drug use, and addiction. But go USA.  These songs are amazing.

Eh, no. Here's a playlist of four amazing yet sad songs related to independence day.  I'm not sure why this holiday bums these people out so much, but so be it!
