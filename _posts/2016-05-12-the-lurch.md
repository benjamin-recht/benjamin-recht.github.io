Ack!  This regular blogging thing is hard.  You let one week slip and then you’re in deficit.  The semester has wrapped here, and I think I’ll have time to actually write again. If everything goes according to plan, we’ll have a fun summer of optimization posts here.  And I will certainly keep up the regular music posts regardless.

The problem with doing a song of the week this week is it seems like *everyone’s* song of the week is “True Love Waits.”  It would be highly unoriginal of me to go tell you to listen to Radiohead, but the version of “True Love Waits” on *A Moon Shaped Pool* is truly awesome.  So do go and listen to it.

But also listen to this great sequenced post-rock jam “The Lurch” by Two Lone Swordsmen.   I give two thumbs up to any song with double tracked bass guitar.  This formula never fails.  “The Lurch” additionally captures my current mood of being optimistic after plodding through the semester and looking forward to a summer of fun projects.
