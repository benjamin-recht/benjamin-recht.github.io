Part 11/x. I'll keep logging parts here as they come. I am hoping that x ends up being less than 100...

## Table of Contents.

1. [Make It Happen.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/01/29/taxonomy/) Reinforcement Learning as prescriptive analytics.
2. [Total Control.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/01/control-tour/) Reinforcement Learning as Optimal Control.
3. [The Linearization Principle.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/05/linearization/) If a machine learning algorithm does crazy things when restricted to linear models, it’s going to do crazy things on complex nonlinear models too.
4. [The Linear Quadratic Regulator.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/08/lqr/) A quick intro to LQR as why it is a great baseline for benchmarking Reinforcement Learning.
5. [A Game of Chance to You to Him Is One of Real Skill.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/14/rl-game/) Laying out the rules of the RL Game and comparing to Iterative Learning Control.
6. [The Policy of Truth.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/20/reinforce/) Policy Gradient is a Gradient Free Optimization Method.
7. [A Model, You Know What I Mean?](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/26/nominal/) Nominal control and the power of models.
8. [Updates on Policy Gradients.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/03/13/pg-saga/) Can we fix policy gradient with algorithmic enhancements?
9. [Clues for Which I Search and Choose.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/03/20/mujocoloco/) Simple methods solve apparently complex RL benchmarks.
10. [The Best Things in Life Are Model Free.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/04/19/pid/) PID control and its connection to optimization methods popular in machine learning.
11. [Catching Signals That Sound in the Dark.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/04/23/ilc/) PID for iterative learning control.
