Part 7/x. I'll keep logging parts here as they come. I am hoping that x ends up being less than 100...

## Table of Contents.

1. [Make It Happen.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/01/29/taxonomy/) Reinforcement Learning as prescriptive analytics.
2. [Total Control.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/01/control-tour/) Reinforcement Learning as Optimal Control.
3. [The Linearization Principle.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/05/linearization/) If a machine learning algorithm does crazy things when restricted to linear models, itâ€™s going to do crazy things on complex nonlinear models too.
4. [The Linear Quadratic Regulator.](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/08/lqr/) A quick intro to LQR as why it is a great baseline for benchmarking Reinforcement Learning.
