I’ll get back to the machine learning and optimization shortly, but I’ve impulsively decided to use this space to indulge all of my random interests.  So here’s my song of the week:  “Not Again” by Ratboys:

I love the way this song is put together.  The double tracked vocals, the over-emphasized dynamic turns, the deliberately sloppy lead guitar.  When I was in college in Chicago, there was a near infinite number of bands that sounded something like this.  This was following the wave of local bands like Urge Overkill, Veruca Salt, and Liz Phair that even made it on the radio.  They were never the hippest---that designation was reserved for the math rock and post-rock bands.  But there’s something in the water in Chicago (I think it’s called beer) that gets everyone yelling out wistful longing and sadness in the form of loud pop rock.
